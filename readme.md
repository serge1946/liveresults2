### Description

The **liveresults** software is a web-based system for the real-time display of bouldering results for competitions using the 2011 IFSC format.

The software is written in standards-compliant HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, making extensive use of the jQuery libraries.

The server elements of the system require a computer running **Apache** server software (version 2.2.19 tested) with PHP5 and SQLite3 installed. The client elements of the system should run without modification on computers running OSX, Windows or Linux, with **Webkit** browsers (e.g. Chrome) as the primary target.
